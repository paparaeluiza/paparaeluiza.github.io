The present journal is a tool in documenting the internship period at Spinderihallerne within Innovation and Business Development Department. This interns mind never pauses, either I write about the activities or plans of tomorrow or I write about the worries of today, this blog is the evidence of my 3 months journey. With great expectation I start, with magnificent life lessons I will finish.

All the cliche that you heard of I am: a fast learner, open minded, ambitious and enthusiastic, always trying to push myself to the limits so I can give my best in everything. But what is far most important to mention is that I have a fine irony hard to keep up with. :D

My story is simple, not so far in the past I was an average person, the average class mate, no special skills, no special interests, no hobbies. Still the past is past and the new me has discovered the power of trying, the power of positive thinking, not afraid of failure. The entrepreneurial mind set is on and nothing can stop me. I will use the present project, “The spinning intern”,  in order to evaluate my 3 months of personal and professional development.

The present photo journal is a tool in documenting my journey in learning all about photography. During the last year I became mesmerized by Pinterest and how information and beautiful experiences are shared through pictures. I can't tell how many hours per week I spent on Pinterest creating boards. This is a life style. :)

During my long hours of research on the above mentioned app, I found out about the 30/31 days photo challenge. And I said to my self, why not try it? The plan is to snap a picture every day following the list with daily photo challenges. Every month I will make a post with "the list" and everyday I will post a picture on this photo journal.

Just have in mind I am not a professional, I do not have any experience whatsoever but I would like to learn more about photography.

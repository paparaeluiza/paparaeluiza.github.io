    &lt;p&gt;First day as an intern is related with the newness of the situation; new people, new names, new faces, new place. One single ting was familiar my Internship coordinator Lars Niels Henriksen and ……….. the minions. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very begging my desk was waiting with the cutest message from the team and the minions. In every corner of the room the minions were watching. It may appear that they have changed their strategy and their ultimate purpose is more peaceful as making at ease the interns first day and even the intern stay and forgot all about finding the most despicable master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before the first day was paved with a lot of NEW. The surrounding is amazing, happy smiling colleagues, inspirational businesses. The building is decorate in such a manner that wherever you look you get to learn from all the facts on the wall or on the floor. On the walls you can find  display of the Business Canvas, on the floor you may read the Stage- Gate model and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met the colleagues that make Spinderihallerne “spinning”, from the financial department to the top leader. People with beautiful minds that create unbelievable projects; how does it sound a use of the philosophy paradigms in solving social problems or business issues, or a haunted house right on the back of Spinderihallerne all provided by Dystopia team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The building, the people……..the minions they are such an inspiration. The entire environment is the best place for being creative, innovate and learn from the best.&lt;/p&gt;

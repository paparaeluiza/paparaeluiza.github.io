I was writing a couple of posts ago about the impact prejudices have on creativity; it is important to be aware of them but what is more relevant is our attitude towards overcoming this blockages. Today's article may sound as a repetition but it is an invitation to reflect on *How easy you give up on your dreams?*

Let's imagine the following scenario. You have received an assignment, with an interesting topic you do not know anything about. First you become nervous, what if you won't be able to solve the task that was given to you? __You block.__ After 10 minutes you begin to research, to read more about the topic in matter. Then you start to understand the topic, find some example from your experience, make the assignment more personal. Things seem that are back on track. But ... at the end of your assignment you are supposed to offer a solution. __You block, again.__ Your mind begin to work against you, as if there are no more solution left in this world. The worst part is that your job is to use innovation and really find the impossible solution. After long frustrations you just remember that one time when you managed to survive a situation with the most easy solution ever. And you plan to use the same solution for your assignment. Your leader, the higher power, decides you have done a very good job and actually your solution may be used, in such a way that you are in charge of implementing it. Exactly when you were hoping the job is done ... __you block__, a new challenge is ahead you. What do you do next? Stop? Continue? 

You are the higher power, you should be aware that after every __block__ will be others until you achieve your dream. You should never give up, because that's why dreams die. You must breathe ... breathe ... and persevere by starting from where you left.

To have a dream it is not enough and, the step, to make it happen is the hardest. Our prejudices become barriers for the creative process and working with an open mind may be difficult. I have been writing about the impact, the limits we set, have on a brilliant idea, but how many times we find the motivation to overcome this limits, is another question.

Let's imagine the following scenario. You have received an assignment, with an interesting topic, you do not know anything about. First you become nervous, what if you won't be able to solve the task that was given to you? __You block.__ After 10 minutes you begin to research, to read more about the topic in matter. Then you start to understand the topic, find some example from your experience, make the assignment more personal. Things seem that are back on track. But ... at the end of your assignment you are supposed to offer a solution. __You block, again.__ Your mind begin to work against you, as if there are no more solution left in this world. The worst part is that your job is to use innovation and really find the impossible solution. After long frustrations you just remember that one time when you managed to survive a situation with the most easy solution ever. And you plan to use the same solution for your assignment, as well. Your leader, the higher power, decides you have done a very good job and actually your solution may be used, in such a way that you are in charge of implementing it. Exactly when you were hoping the job is done ... __you block.__

You are the higher power, you should be aware that only you can make dreams happen and start acting. It is not enough to have a dream and leave this matter unfinished. You must persist, become an achiever and work until the end, where only *positive something* happens. Today's article may sound so Captain Obvious, but it is an invitation to reflect on *How easy you give up on your dreams?*

One week ago I started to research for my BA report, and about 4 ideas came to my mind, I was so confident that I am working with a open mind and that I was so  productive. Little did I know that that was the  first phase of creativity: possibility. But then, on Tuesday, doubt phase came and I start questioning my judgement and all my not so clever ideas. By the time Wednesday ended I was in full agony phase, and I begin to worry that I will not be able to fulfill the expectations. By Thursday my mind was stuck on something that seemed as a reasonable solution.

But today it was a big day. Together with my internship coordinator, Lars, we discussed about my future theme for the BA report. The conversation turned out so productive, that not only I set the problem statement but also the analysis questions. It is so strange the feeling that I experience, I just feel happiness and hope.

I was thinking today abut this moment, the __OH__ moment, when you know you just have it, that it is yours. The creative people will name it the epiphany, is that phase when all the puzzle pieces fit together, and you can see nothing but light. :boom:
Well the moment didn't turned me blind but I become aware that there is a direction.

I am still thinking at what happened today and the process that I am passing through, and how situations like this sets hope. I feel incredible joy when I create value, when I am developing, when I am trying.

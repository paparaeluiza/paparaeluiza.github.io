"This is stupid!", "I can't do it!", "God, is too dificult!", "I don't know how; it's too complicated!", "The others will think I'm stupid." We all have this thoughts most of the time when action needs to be taken.

Not so long time ago I was not aware that there are studies on how to overcome the mind blocks and avoid shutdown. The thing is that whenever this thoughts appear our creativity disappears. I think it will be such a sad world if all the brilliant minds had fallowed their negative thoughts; a world with no electricity, no phones, no cars, no internet. All this inventions did not appear over night, them are the result of thousands of attempts and millions of mind blocks chased away.

Perseverance and positive thinking is the key to __greatness__. Even though I am aware of the impact negative thinking has on my development, I often get caught in the mind block's games. And what happens is that feeds even more my insecurities, delays my success, shuts down my development, blocks my creativity. Now it doesn't happens that often like before but when it does after a short while the fighter mindset returns and encourages me; "You can make it!", "Just try it, what can happen?", "Go and do it!". Sometime there are this tasks that just scares me, seem so hard to accomplish, but then I try it, I do it and realize it was hard only in my mind.

When __The spinning intern__ project came through my mind, the very first thoughts were to backdown, to kill my idea. I knew I am not good in coding, I was worried about my writing ability, I was insecure about so many things, but what speaks to me every time, restarting the open, creative thinking mode is my motto.

>Positive something is better than negative nothing.

That's why I encourage you to chase away all your mind blocks and negative thinking, to try and if that is all it takes to get the job done and to accomplish your dream, make a full out of yourself. Do not limit yourself, do not stop from achieving greatness!!!

PS: This time no help from __The Specialist__ was required in finding the markup for citation. I guess I developed a new skill: coding. :smirk:

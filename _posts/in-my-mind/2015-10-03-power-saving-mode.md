How many times you had been procrastinating and losing the time notion? How many times you wished to have more time to study for an examen or to write a project? We complain of not having enough time and end up watching "Gossip Girl" or cats and dogs funny videos on You Tube.

One year ago I just come to my senses. I stared to think on the situation I was, and I realized that I was prioritizing my actions completely irrational. So I decided to set personal goals, place them on a time frame and write it down on paper. It is important to create a purpose of your daily activities and have a focus, a course of action and an outcome that will help you improve in your professional or personal life. It may sound very cheesy but like many of you, 10 months ago, I set my New Year's resolution. I made a list with wishes and dreams, goals that I thought it will help me develop. Up next I will share, my 5 goals list, that I found relevant at the beginning of 2015.

* Apply for education to learn danish, so by the end of the year the situation will improve.
* Prepare to apply for internships in April, so by June several places are consider and a series of internship interviews will be taken.
* Release the blog in August.
* Quit the job, that makes you so unhappy, by the time the internship starts.
* Take dance classes at the end of the year.

The thing with setting goals and writing them down is that you begin to feel guilty if you don't try to fulfill them, so I found it as a useful motivation tool for getting things done. I am proud to declare that 4 goals from the above list I managed to accomplish, taking dance classes is the only one not fulfilled so far.

Having an organized action plan it helps to channel your energy towards what really matters. You need to be aware of your energy level and if it's worthy to do things that offers nothing back. Once in a while is good to have a break and think about the process but it is not worthy if the break doesn't charges your battery.

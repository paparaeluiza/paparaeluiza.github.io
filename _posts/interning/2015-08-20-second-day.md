The second day was full of research and desk work.

Yet I have made a big discovery that transformed my lunch break into one hour break. Spinderihallerne hosts an very interesting museum right inside the building .... and it is for free. The museum covers the history of Vejle region, with interesting facts and stories. It is a time travel experience dated way back in the Iron Age and its sacrifices, followed by the Renaissance trade, shipping and wars and ending with 1800-1900 development of the industry.

The innovative display and installation will transpose you into the woods, close to the bog where is the resting place of Queen Gunhild. Then you have the opportunity to take a 3D tour of Vejle's Renaissance harbor, by sailing around the world using the big maps. Or  hear stories about the danish intervention during the 30 years war (1618-1648) which generate a stagnation in the development of the country. At the end of your visit you will be able to find out more about the 1800 development of Vejle region and the history behind the old building(that today houses Spinderihallerne) from the day when the machines were running at the cotton factory.

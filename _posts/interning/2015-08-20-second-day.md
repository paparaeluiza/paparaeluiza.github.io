Starting with the second day I got to work with a project that you will read more about it in the next post.

But the big discovery that I made today transformed my lunch break into one hour break. What I didn't know was that Spinderihallerne hosts a very interesting museum right inside the building .... and it is for free. The museum covers the history of Vejle region, with interesting facts and stories. It is a time travel experience dated way back in the Iron Age, followed by the Renaissance trade and wars and ending with 1800-1900 development of the industry.

The innovative display and installation will transpose you into the woods, close to the bog where it is the resting place of Queen Gunhild, afterwards you can take a short tour in the, Vejle's Renaissance, harbor, sail around the world using the big maps or hear stories about the danish intervention during the 30 years war (1618-1648). At the end of your visit you will be able to find out more about the 1800 development of Vejle region and the history behind the old building(that today houses Spinderihallerne) from the day when the machines were running at the cotton factory.

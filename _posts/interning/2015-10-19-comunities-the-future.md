A year ago, I moved from Odense to Vejle, leaving behind all my friends, all the familiar places and the big city life. It took me more than 9 months to adjust to the new city. It took me 9 months of constant week-end visits to Odense, to realize that Vejle has also so much to offer. What shift my perception was the groups that I joined and the people I met.

Due to my internship at Spinderihallerne I started to be aware of the events and projects that happens in Vejle. I presented a particular interest in one project which aims at building a community of awesome, strong partners that followed the loved ones across the borders and ended up in Vejle. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/spousehousevejle/" target="_blank">Spouse House Vejle</a> seemed to me the right group to join. What is cool about this group is that its constant meetings aims at helping its members to share their experiences, generates, group discussions about culture, job market, how to cope with the danish winter or the danes and offer solutions for practical things. The group, so far, counts about 293 members, and for a group of this size the different backgrounds and interests is for me a constant source of knowledge. Since I am member of the group I am aware about the latest events in Vejle and surroundings, I get invitations to different events and I am informed and active.

The second group that I joined recently is the Vejle's kommune interns network (more info [here](http://www.vejle.dk/Job/Praktik-i-Vejle-Kommune/Praktikanterne-om-praktikken/Praktikanter-2015.aspx)). Why I enjoy being part of this group is that I have the opportunity to share my experience as an intern, and the challenges. I think it helps so much to hear that the other members have been facing similar problems as me, that the beginning was difficult and strange for them as well, that the first day in the lunch room was awkward or that the projects for school makes the process more complicated.

What I like about being involved in a group is the sense of belonging. The purpose of joining this groups is to keep myself busy, be active and feed my mind. And I have to admit it increases my network and may become a helping hand when the situation will need it.

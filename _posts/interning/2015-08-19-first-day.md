The first day as an intern was all about the new people, the new names, the new faces and the new place. Yet, in the middle of all this madness, a couple of things were familiar; my internship coordinator,[Lars Henrik Nielsen ](https://www.facebook.com/LarsHenrikNielsen) and ... the minions. :) The cutest message, from the team and the minions, welcomed me on the new office.

 May appear that the minions have changed their strategy and forgot all about finding the most despicable master. The ultimate purpose for the minions in our office was to ease this interns first day. See for yourself my new minion friends.

The building is decorate in such a manner that it is vocal and speaks to you, wherever you look you get to learn from everything that surrounds you, the walls, the floors.

Today I met the colleagues that make Spinderihallerne “spinning”, from the financial department to the top leader, people with beautiful minds that create unbelievable projects. I got to hear about two projects, one who deals with using philosophical paradigms in solving social problems and business issues and the other one about the [Dystopia's team](https://www.facebook.com/DystopiaEntertainment?fref=ts) haunted house placed right on Spinderihallerne's yard.
The building, the people...the minions they are such an inspiration. The entire environment is the best place for being creative, innovate and learn from the best.

Today I got the opportunity to go "backstage" on an evolving project. Today I realized how much work and time are used until a project finally reaches the implementation phase. I will not be able to offer details about the project, the informations were handed in as confidential but I will mention that the UN was involved.

After the meeting I was able to create a list with the most important aspects that need to be taken into consideration while initiating a project:

* A major wish for helping and improving a problematic situation.
* Defining the right problem, the right target group and the right implementation actions.
* The relationship with the collaboration partners.
* The funding.
* The "competition" - the other projects that try to solve the same problem as your project.
* The bureaucracy behind the process

Through the process it may be useful the opinion of an “outsider” - that person who was not on board since day one, that person that may lack the expertise but may observe what hinders the project. The "outsider" may be that person that represents a different perspective.

I was the “outsider” today, and it was a productive meeting, where the issues that has stalled the project were identified and a new plan was discussed. At the end of my first internship week I had a feeling of fulfillment.

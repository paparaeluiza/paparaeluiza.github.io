Starting from August I am on the last semester of my education, even if it doesn't feel this way. Apart for checking Fronter every week, for the latest informations, I didn't had much contact with the school atmosphere. Is a strange feeling to be a student but to not attend classes every day and meet your teachers and classmates. I guess this is a transition period that helps me adapt for the next stage in my life.

The internship period seems like a complex emotional time, where you prepare for the job market, and leave behind your classmates' silly jokes. Today, Hans my internship coordinator, visited Spinderihallerne. Why I write about this visit is it made me feel that I was back to school. We talked about my activity so far and also about my future BA project. It feels comforting to know that a second person has my back along the process, presenting interest about my tasks, my BA topic, my development and my learning process.

It seemed like I was back to school where the teacher guided me to best fulfill my objectives. It was interesting to observe how the meeting fallowed a time frame with focus on my past activities, on my present focus, the internship report, and on my future, as in what will happen after graduation. I have to admit it was a good reflection exercise forcing me to think about my future, as a graduate.

So today's meeting made me dream about a day at school surrounded by my classmates and our teachers. I hope you, lovely people, are doing just fine?!?

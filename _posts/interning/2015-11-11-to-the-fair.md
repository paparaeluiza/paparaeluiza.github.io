Oh how time flies, when you deal with serious businesses. 2 weeks have past since my last post, but I have been dealing with school projects. Last week I have worked in parallel at two projects, my internship report that I handed it in and my BA report research. I focused my last month on the school projects and to little on other events. But today I got back in business, I had been the judge assistant for the Vejle Edison competition.

Edison is a project-oriented courses for 6th and 7th graders. The students used their creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship knowledge to develop concepts or products that aimed at solving problems or improving the quality of life for a large group of people in society. Today the different teams exhibited and competed with each other at the local event in Vejle municipality. At the fair the products and the concepts were assessed and compared by external judges who rewarded the best projects. The Edison course will culminate in a major national exhibition, where students compete to win the 2015 Edison Prize.

It was refreshing to be out of the office among the young generation of future entrepreneurs. :bowtie: And man, what over the top displays, prototypes and ideas they had. If you don't believe me see for yourself.

What I have learned from this experience, is that it was hard to judge the students projects in an objective manner. Like everywhere there were good projects and less inspired projects, but it was important to support the participation and the small brains at the presentation table. I also consider that is a very good strategy, from an educational point of view, to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit at such a young age.

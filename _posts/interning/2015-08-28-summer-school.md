During the last 2 days I had the opportunity to participate at an inspiring event: the Innovation summer school organized by the creative people from Spinderihallerne.

The 2 days activities generated a lot of knowledge in this interns mind in fields like Innovation, Productivity, Resilience and Leadership. It was ones guide on how to inspire as a leader, how to become a graphic artist or how to built up communities in order to solve the most drastic problems the mankind faces.

There were two activities that draw my attention. The workshop that taught me to wonder all the time. It may sound strange but is so important to always ask questions in order to discover the _real_ reasons of the peoples actions and decisions. Just asking a simple *why?* you open the world of *because* and a million of solutions. Another interesting lesson was that criticizing promotes innovation, in such a way that builds up more questions and better solutions.
For me is just unbelievable how Denmark manages to innovate and educate. If you ask me  I perceive the public sector as very standardized, managing in an old fashion way, where there is not that much of flexibility to be creative. The "Why wonder workshop" aimed at changing the perception of the public servants and the manner how daily tasks are conducted. All the participants were encouraged to wonder, ask question and philosophize.
The second activity that I was looking forward was the Skype dialogue with the one and only Otto Scharmer. Otto Scharmer is the developer of Theory U or in other words how to embrace the open mind, open heart and open will for a better performance.

There were two days full of learning!

PS: Wonder! because you are on the good path if the answer of your question generates another question.

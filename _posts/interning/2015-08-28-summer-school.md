During the last 2 days I had the opportunity to participate at an inspiring event: the Innovation summer school organized by the creative people from Spinderihallerne.

The 2 days activities generated a lot of knowledge in this interns mind in fields like Innovation, Productivity, Resilience and Leadership. It was ones guide on how to inspire as a leader, how to become a graphic artist or how to built up communities in order to solve the most drastic problems the earth faces.

There were tow activities that draw my attention. The workshop that taught us how to wonder all the time. It may sound strange but is so important to always ask questions in order to discover the REAL reasons of the peoples actions and decisions. Just asking a simple “why?”you open the world of “because” and of a million of solutions. Another interesting lesson was that criticizing promotes innovation, in such a way that builds up more questions and better solutions.
For me is just unbelievable how Denmark manages to innovate and educate. We all know that the public sector is very rigid, standardized. If you ask me  I will characterize it as a form of managing old fashion way, where you do not have so much of flexibility to be creative. So the workshop aimed at changing the perception of the public servants related with their tasks. All the participants were encouraged to wonder, ask question and philosophize.
The second activity that I was looking forward was the Skype dialogue with the one and only Otto Scharmer, the developer of Theory U or in other words how to embrace the open mind, open heart and open will for a better performance.
There were two days full of learning! And remember, wonder because you are on the good path if the answer of your question generates another question.

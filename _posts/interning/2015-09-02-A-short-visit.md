Today Vejle got its festive look. Danemark's royal pair visited the city as part of their summer cruise. One of the stops during this visit was Spinderihallerne, and the minions office that become royal's pair resting room.
I can not mention, the excitement, when I was informed about this visit. Spinderi's people talked about this event for weeks and visible changes occurred on the last two days. A protocol was set and shared among all the employees and several visit rules were listed.

The shocking part, for me, was the "no special" dress code rule. The first time when I heard about the visit I already imagined how I am going to dress, my ivory dress with high heels were expecting for an occasion like this since I bought them. Well plan A dissolved and I had to adapt with the visit protocol. Everybody had to behave as natural as a normal day at work, therefore I had to tone down my excitement and the outfit. :bowtie:

Another rule was that between 8:45 and 13:45 no person was allowed to get inside or out of the building. High security measures were taken and everybody got serious about it.
The building got festive also, the flags were standing tall and the event hall transformed for the royal brunch.

With all the preparation the visit was quite short.

* The queen arrived, received the most unbelievable paper flower bouquet.
* The queen visited the Spinderihallerne Museum.
* The queen was introduced to two of the most successful projects: Dystopia Entertainment and <a href="http://www.roervang.com/" target="_blank">Thomas RÃ¸rvang</a> furniture maker.
* The queen tried Thomas's chair.
* The choir begin singing - marking the beginning of the brunch.
* The choir begin singing, again- marking the end of the brunch and also the end of the visit.

The funny thing was that the __"behave as natural day"__ fast escalated and everybody turned into photographers prepared to snap a shot. I do not know if somebody managed to work today but for sure it was a memorable day.

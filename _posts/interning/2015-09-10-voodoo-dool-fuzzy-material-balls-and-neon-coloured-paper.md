Today when I arrived at the office a big Tiger bag got my attention. In the bag dozens of colored things, small letters, big letters, neon colored paper, monster stickers, florescent bracelets, colored plastic cups, voodoo doll, small fuzzy material balls and many other crazy, colored resources. This bag full of madness was prepared for a facilitation workshop.

 The facilitated group was the Spinderihallerne's purchase and insurance department. Usually the purpose of facilitation is to discover new ways of working, new perspectives for solving problems, improve oneself, the department or the organization. Usually the playing approach is used to create the right mind set for developing ideas, solutions. During the workshop all the participant had to play with the resources in order to physically build the future of their department in 100 years from now. Both groups come up with this Science Fiction scenarios where machines and artificial intelligence will do all the job for the mankind. The rule is that there is no such thing as stupid ideas and the most impossible and crazy it gets the better for the process. It was interesting to observe how the participants, for a couple of hours, let go of all their prejudices and barriers,and played, created and innovated themselves.

Why it was useful to assist to the facilitation workshop?

Because it was interesting to discover the techniques I have learned in school and observe them applied in a real situation. I have recognized the trend spotting tool that was used to predict the future and the prototyping technique that helped transform the ideas in reality on a small scale. This gave me a small amount of satisfaction knowing that what I learned in school wasn't for nothing.

What I have learned new from the facilitation workshop?

I was introduced with two new tools; the trend card game, a game aiming at ease the process of discussions and future prediction and the critique method used in order for the participants to come up with the best detailed solution. I also had to opportunity to find answers to a dilemma I had related with the facilitation process and the facilitator role.  I plan to remember and use this new tools and advices when the situation will require it.

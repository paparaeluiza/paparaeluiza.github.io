The life of a project on the backstage. How much work there is needed and time is used until a project finally gets to be launched. Collaboration- partners, finding the right founding. The bumpy road  having to deal with competition, having to please de founding organization, too many interests – finding the right focus, the right target group and the right implementation actions.  The bureaucracy behind the process and the wish for improvement, change and helping.

It may really help through a project process to ask the opinion of an “outsider”- that person that haven't been on board with the project since day one, that person that may lack the expertise in the field but may observe what is the problem, what hinder the project. The outsider may be the person who will dare to tell the truth when nobody else is doing it. So it have been a productive meeting where the problem that the project deals with have been defined and a new plan emerged.

I was the “outsider” and we had a productive meeting, that put back on track the process of this top secret project.
